# Mindcloud

Mindcloud was a collaborative project between [Serubin](https://github.com/Serubin) and [shoelick](https://github.com/shoelick) completed in Spring 2015. 

It was presented at Imagine RIT and received signficant positive feedback.

The purpose of the project was to provide a Quora-like environment for sharing problems and market discovery. Users would post complaints or problems within every day life. Engineers or entrepeneurs would be provided with data about the complaints, and could propose solutions. The original contributors of the problem could then provide feedback on the solution.

The project was discontinued due to other obligations and interest.
